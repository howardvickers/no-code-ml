### Project Introduction
This is a personal project to create a web app that

Machine Learning and Data Science present two main barriers to entry:
* Coding skills (eg python, R, etc)
* Theoretical background (eg statistics, math etc)

This web app explores how this barrier can be overcome with a point-n-click interface to use machine learning techniques that normally require good knowledge of python, pandas, numpy and similar programming skills.

The second barrier can be overcome with step-by-step guidance and training; this is beyond the scope of this project.

Note that the web app is intended as a conceptual project rather than a commercial product.  

### Business Context
This project is guided by a sense of a hyperthetical, yet practical business situation: a startup has sales or other data that is available as a csv file and wishes to gain insights into the data; perhaps a desire to predict future sales and to understand where to employ resources for the best performance.  


### Functionality
The web app offers/will offer the following functionality:
* upload csv files
* view initial rows (equivalent to df.head() in pandas)
* select columns for regression analysis
* change column names
* compare regressions with different tools (linear, random forest, etc)
* save resulting datasets and regression analyses
