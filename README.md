### Project Introduction
This is a personal project to create a web app that allows someone with no coding experience to run machine learning algorithms on business data.

Machine Learning and Data Science present two main barriers to entry:
* Coding skills (eg python, R, etc)
* Theoretical background (eg statistics, math etc)

This web app explores how the first barrier can be overcome with a point-n-click interface to use machine learning techniques that normally require good knowledge of python, pandas, numpy and similar programming skills.

The second barrier could be addressed with step-by-step guidance and training; this is considered beyond the immediate scope of this project.

Note that the web app is intended as a conceptual project rather than a commercial product. It aims to showcase the programmer's combined skillset of data science and web dev.

### Business Context
This project is guided by a sense of a hyperthetical, yet practical business situation: a startup has sales or other data that is available as a csv file and wishes to gain insights into the data; perhaps a desire to predict future sales and to understand where to employ resources for the best performance.  

### Functionality (Bold represents working)
The web app offers/will offer the following functionality:
* **upload csv files**
* **view initial rows (equivalent to df.head() in pandas)**
* **change column names**
* **select columns for regression analysis**
* select columns using jquery (without page refresh)
* compare regressions with different tools (linear, random forest, etc)
* save resulting datasets and regression analyses
* manually delete all saved files at end of session

### Technologies Employed
* python
* numpy
* pandas
* flask
* jinja
* javascript
* jquery
* ajax
* bootstrap
* html
* css
